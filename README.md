# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-scikit-learn
 The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font.        Recognizing handwritten text is a problem that traces back to the first automatic machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents. Think about, for example, the ZIP codes on letters at the post office and the automation needed to recognize these five digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary to sort mail automatically and efficiently. Included among the other applications that may come to mind is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.
